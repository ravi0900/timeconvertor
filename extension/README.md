# Time Tools Converter - Chrome Extension

This directory contains the files for the Time Tools Converter Chrome extension.

## Icon Setup

The Chrome extension requires PNG icons in multiple sizes. An SVG icon has been provided in `extension/icons/icon.svg`. You must convert this SVG to the following PNG files:

- `extension/icons/icon16.png` (16x16 pixels)
- `extension/icons/icon48.png` (48x48 pixels)
- `extension/icons/icon128.png` (128x128 pixels)

You can use an online SVG to PNG converter tool to generate these files.

## How to Load the Extension in Chrome

1.  Open Google Chrome.
2.  Navigate to `chrome://extensions/`.
3.  Enable "Developer mode" using the toggle switch in the top-right corner.
4.  Click the "Load unpacked" button that appears.
5.  In the file selection dialog, select the `extension` directory from this project.
6.  The "Time Tools Converter" extension should now appear in your list of extensions and in your Chrome toolbar.
